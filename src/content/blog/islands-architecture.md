Astro's islands approach lets you keep most pages static while selectively hydrating the parts that need motion or state.

## Island checklist
- Hydrate only what users can interact with.
- Keep props small and serializable.
- Prefer server-rendered HTML when possible.

## Practical win
You get the best of both worlds: performance and personality.
