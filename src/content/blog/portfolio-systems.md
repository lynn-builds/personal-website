Shipping a portfolio is easy. Keeping it current is the hard part. I build mine like a product with repeatable patterns and small content updates.

## What helps most
- Content collections for project data.
- Shared layouts for consistent voice.
- A minimal design token system.

## The payoff
Once the system is set, new projects take minutes to publish.
