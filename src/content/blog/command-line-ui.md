Command-line aesthetics can do more than look cool. They focus the reader, reduce visual noise, and help establish a rhythm for scanning.

## Patterns I reuse
- Command-like headers to frame sections.
- Monospaced microcopy for labels and metadata.
- Pill buttons to hint at tactile input.

## Where it can go wrong
If every element screams "terminal", the interface starts to feel like a parody. Balance the metaphor with a clear reading hierarchy.
