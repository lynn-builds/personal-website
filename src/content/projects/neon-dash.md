## Brief
Built a responsive analytics workspace for product teams tracking live metrics. The system supports multi-tenant workspaces, configurable data sources, and exportable snapshots.

## Highlights
- Designed a widget builder with drag-and-drop layout presets.
- Added anomaly detection cues and threshold-based alerts.
- Integrated accessibility-first color tokens and keyboard navigation.

## Outcome
Teams reduced time-to-insight by 35% after switching from CSV exports to the live dashboard.
