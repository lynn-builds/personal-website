## Brief
A unified control room for edge fleets that needed fast triage, API-first telemetry, and simple audit logging.

- Implemented role-based access and incident timelines.
- Delivered a searchable log explorer with saved filters.

## Outcome
Reduced incident response time by 42% through faster diagnostics and tighter alert grouping.
